## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The colored Pretty format brackets the target, matching the documented layout — colors are on by default in `preset_development()`, so the documented form was the one nobody saw.

### Fixed

- The colored Pretty formatter emits the brackets around the target (`[my_app]`), matching the documented format. They were dropped only on the colored path — which `preset_development()` enables by default, so the documented shape was the one almost nobody saw.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Requirements on sibling armature crates name a minor instead of `0`. Under
  Cargo's 0.x rules `version = "0"` matches any release ever made, and edition
  2024 selects the MSRV-aware resolver, so a consumer declaring an older
  `rust-version` was handed the oldest version satisfying it — resolving
  `armature-core = "0"` on Rust 1.89 produced `armature-core 0.2.3` while an
  explicit `armature-core = "0.8"` elsewhere in the same graph pulled 0.8.2.
  Two copies of core, and a build failing on symbols the older one lacks. Each
  0.x minor in this family is a breaking change, so the requirement now names
  one. No API change.
